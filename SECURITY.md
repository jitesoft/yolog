## Reporting a Vulnerability

Best way to report a vulnerability is to send an email to `sec@jitesoft.com`.  
Make the subject `Yolog vulnerability` and give a description (and if possible a reproducible example) on the vulnerability.

Security issues will be patched on high priority basis, and we try to give the users of the module an alert of a required update
as soon as it have been patched, vulnerabilities will be made public 15 days after a fix is implemented.

## Bug bounties

As of right now, we offer no bounties for vulnerability reporting.
