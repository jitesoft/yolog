Hi!

Vulnerability reports should be sent to `sec@jitesoft.com` or reported in the [GitHub security advisories](https://github.com/jitesoft/yolog/security/advisories) board as a private advisory.  
 
_Please do not post security vulnerabilities public until we have had a chance to patch and roll out an update!_
